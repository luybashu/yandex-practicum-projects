# yandex-praktikum-projects
These projects were completed during my 8-month studies in the "Data Science Specialist" program at Yandex.Practicum.<br>
All projects are in Russian, and have descriptions in English.

| Project name | Description | Libraries used | Fields | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [5. Computer Games Market Analysis.](big_cities_music) | Detailed analysis of historical open-source game sales data to optimize advertising campaigns and enhance sales for the upcoming year for an online computer games store. Based on EDA insights and statistical hypothesis testing, recommendations were formulated for game genres, platforms, and regional sales. | `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `SciPy` | *Games*<br> *Data Analysis, A/B testing* |
| [9. Gold Recovery Prediction.](big_cities_music) | Prediction of recovery coefficients of gold at the different stages of recovery process to prevent unprofitable processes in gold mining and refining company. The project includes the analysis of historical data from different stages of gold recovery and the development of a complex model that can predict the recovery coefficients of gold. | `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn` | *Industry*<br> *ML, Regression* |
| [12. Forecasting Taxi Orders.](big_cities_music) | Accurately predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour is crucial for optimizing the operation of a taxi company. This project includes time-series analysis of historical data on taxi orders at airports, feature generation, and the development of a relatively accurate and fast ML model to predict number of future taxi orders. | `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Statsmodels`, `Catboost`, `LightGBM` | *Transport services*<br> *ML, Time series* |
| [13. Classification of Comments.](big_cities_music) | Detection of toxic comments for moderation is required for an online store to provide a safe environment. Using a collection of labelled comments an ML model to classify comments into toxic and neutral was developed. Comment texts were preprocessed by lemmatization with pos-tagging and then vectorized using TF-IDF. | `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `LightGBM`, `WordCloud`| *Internet services*<br> *ML, NLP, Classification* |
| [15. Age Detection by Photo.](big_cities_music) | Customer age detection at the checkout of supermarket can help to suggest relevant products based on customer age and to monitor cashiers' compliance with regulations regarding alcohol sales. In this project CNN-based ML model was developed to detect the age of customers from their photos. | `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`| *Offline services*<br> *ML, Computer Vision* |
| [16. Alloy Temperature Prediction. Final project.](big_cities_music) | Predicting the alloy temperature at the end of processing can help reduce energy consumption and optimize production costs in the steel mill. The project includes the analysis of historical data from different stages of steel processing and the development of a model that can predict the final temperature of the alloy with low error. | `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Catboost`, `LightGBM` | *Industry*<br> *ML, Regression* |
